  <h2>Layout-Property migration from Pentaho Reporting 3.9.1 or older to Pentaho Reporting 4.0.0</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    Before you can use any existing report with the new crosstab-elements or any new layout capabilities
    you must migrate the reports to the Pentaho Reporting 4.0 format. This migration corrects invalid
    properties that were not evaluated in older versions. The converter will reset these properties to their
    built-in default values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reports, groups and group-bodies that have a 'layout' style-property defined get reset to the default
    undefined state.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Pentaho Reporting 4.0 the reporting engine works correctly with the <code>min-width/width/max-width</code>
    and <code>min-height/height/max-height</code> constraints. Old reports get migrated to the new system.
  </p>
  <p>
    For elements that have no height or width values defined, all min-width and min-height style properties are
    moved to width and height.
