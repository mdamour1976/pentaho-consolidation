# Defines that the Graphics2D and PDF output will ignore the regular border

# Defines, that the output target will dump the currently processed page to

# makes sense to activate this property, if you are debugging the report layout

# Defines, whether the watermark section will be printed by the report processor.
# This setting is usually configured on the report level, not globally.
# A printing target might use this setting do disable printing of the the form layout

# Defines in which resolution the generated images should be printed. If the image
# is not available in a suitable size for the given layouted output size, the image
# will be scaled to fit the specified device resolution.
#
# For the sake of backward compatibility, we define the device resolution to be
# 72 DPI. This way, a pixel equals a point in the rendering.

# Defines, whether scaling should use the device's native scaling, which may or may
# not produce sensible results, or whether the images should be pre-scaled using a
# internal image scaling algorithm.
