  <h2>Layout-Property migration from Pentaho Reporting 3.8.3 or older to Pentaho Reporting 3.9.0</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
      This migration removes all existing widow and orphan properties that may be defined on any of the
      report elements. The widow/orphan settings were not working on 3.8 version of Pentaho reporting.
      This migration also removes all keep-together flags from non-bands, like groups and report objects.
