1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

1.2.0:
       * [BUG] PRD-2892: IntegerRounding caused invalid values due to a integer overflow

       * [BUG] PRD-2841: Rounding was wrong most of the time. The JDK defaults to a american
         bankers rounding system (round towards the next even number) instead of the mathematical
         rounding the rest of the world uses. And to make matters worse, there is no way to
         teach the decimal format a different rounding mode.

         Although JDK 1.6 allows to control the rounding mode, we cannot use that one. We are
         still on JDK 1.5 and stay there for the next century or so. We therefore round the
         value based on the expected pattern size before we try to format the value.

1.1.2: (2009-09-25)
       * [BUG] PRD-1937: A NullPointerException in FastMessageFormat#setLocale
         existed. Not all subformats have a own formatter.
         
1.1.0: (2009-07-29)
       * [BUG] Choice-Format support in FastMessageFormat was broken.

0.1.0: (2008-05-30)

       * Initial release.

       * The message-format class extends the pattern syntax of the JDK message format
         to allow to quote special characters like curly baces.

       * All formats provided here behave significantly faster on cloning, as they treat
         format-objects as immutable and generate new ones if a property has changed.
