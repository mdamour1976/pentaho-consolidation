1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

1.2.0:
       * [BUG] PRD-1584: Font-Size, Font-Name and Font-Color components did not
          react to style changes of selected elements. The combobox ignored all
          selected values for which there were no values in the model.

       * [BUG] PRD-2844: SwingUtils returned invalid results for centerXXXonScreen
         when working in a multi-screen environment.

       * [BUG] LibSwing: Created new horizontal layout to replace the flow-layout
         with its weird linebreaking behaviour. Added a common toolbar button
         so that we have a central point to configure that kind of functionality.

       * [BUG] Background Execution now has a better message for the user.
         We no longer sleep indefinitely, which led to hanging threads when the task
         was short.

       * PRD-2788: Load and Save directory should be configurable. Provided a
         smarter way to feed directory defaults into the FileChooserService.

       * Extended the boolean cell editor to be a tri-state between "true", "false"
         and "<null>".

       * CommonDialog can now verify input.
         Added GenericCancelHandler to reduce amount of subclassing in user code

       * The FileChooser service was buggy after the rewrite.

       * Added support for user-defined locales for cell-editors and for a general
         locale settings system.

       * Time and Date Cell-Editors can now parse localized strings

       * Time and Date Cell-Editors now produce the correct date/time types and not
         generic java.util.Date objects.

1.1.7:
       * Moved GenericCellRenderer down to PRD-2587 to allow table-datasource-editor
         to render HTML content correctly.

1.1.6: (2010-04-26)
       * The file chooser now has a method to persist its configuration of current
         working directories.

1.1.5: (2010-01-15)
       * [BUG] PRD-2431: Date values were not editable in the table-editor due to a
          bug in the FormattingTableCellRenderer.

1.1.4:
1.1.3: (2009-11-13)
       * Added BorderlessButton. The button looks like a tool-bar button on the Mac.

       * [BUG] CommonDialog now looks better on Metal-PLAF as buttons have some minimum
         spacing.

1.1.2: (2009-09-25)
       * [API] MacOSIntegration now allows feedback from the actions it called. MacOS
         needs that feedback to distribute events correctly.

       * [BUG] WaitDialog must be created on the AWT event dispatcher thread to avoid
         lockups and other bugs.

1.1.1: (2009-08-21)
       * Made the background-execution framework more generic so that it can be used for
         other tasks than just querying tablemodels.

       * [BUG] PRD-1837: DerivedTableModel failed on empty source tables

1.1.0: (2009-07-29)

       * Initial release.

       * Added Bulk-Data actions that allow to reorder and manipulate arrays and lists.

       * Added PropertyEditors for Colors

       * Added CommonDialog, which provides a modal dialog with OK and Cancel buttons.

       * Added FontFamily- and FontSize and Color ComboBoxes

       * Added PaintCellRenderer

       * Added CommonFileChooser which provides a generic entry point to get a configured
         JFileChooser

       * Added framework for executing tasks in the background while displaying a small
         status dialog

       * Added MacOS integration code
