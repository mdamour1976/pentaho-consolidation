1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

1.0.0:
       * All code moved from org.jfree.pixie package space to
         org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.pixie.

0.99.0: (30-May-2008)
       * Jumped to Version Number 1.0 as this library is as feature complete as it will
         get. 

       * Switched from JCommon to LibBase. All version information is now contained in
         the manifest. The Project-Info implementation reads the version numbers from
         the Jar's Manifest or the compiler-output-directory.

       * Without JCommon the WmfFile-class no longer implements the Drawable interface
         directly. Drawable is now considered a calling convention and therefore the
         'draw(Graphics2D,Rectangle2D)' method will remain intact and will now be called
         using Java-Reflection.
         
       * Removed JCommon and replaced it with LibBase. All versioning information now
         comes from the jar's manifest file.

0.8.10: (02-Nov-2007)
       * Upgraded to jcommon-1.0.12

0.8.9: (16-Oct-2007)
       * Automatic fixes as reported by IntelliJ-IDEA's inspections
    
       * Updated the copyright header on all java-files

0.8.8: (24-Sep-2007)
       * All releases are now built with JDK 1.4. However, we are still compatible
         with JDK 1.2.2 and all releases run and compile under that release.
    
       * [Bug] The strikethrough and underline positions were invalid.
         Max-Height was invalid, as the iText descent was returned as negative number.
    
0.8.7: (30-Jul-2007)
       * The WmfFile class now implements the ExtendedDrawable interface and
         therefore provides hints on the natural aspect ratio of the file.

         The preferred size returned by the WmfFile is computed from the operations
         defined in the file; it may or may not reflect the real aspect ratio of the
         image.
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20-Apr-2006 : The WmfFile did not use/obey to the initial image size given in
              the constructor.

17-Apr-2006 : The classes from package org.jfree.pixie.g2recorder have been
              removed.

              Updated JCommon to the latest stable version.

04-Mar-2005 : Another BugFix release for JFreeReport 0.8.5;
              The classes from package org.jfree.pixie.g2recorder are no longer
	  		      included in the release, until they have been completed.

21-Oct-2004 : BugFixes ..

19-Jan-2004 : Some final changes and discontinued for now. Implementing the writing
              support seems useless in a free world, where SVG is available. Some minor
              fixes were made in the WMF-Reading, it is still not complete (and as there
              is no useable documentation available, I doubt it ever will be complete).

              Use SVG instead. 

29-Aug-2002 : Downport to JDK1.2.2 : Altered WmfImageProducer to use less
              memory on producing.
