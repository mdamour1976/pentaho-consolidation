Roadmap: JFreeReport 0.8.x

1. PDF Export: Support for Outline-Trees

Navigating large reports can be a pain. PDF-Outlines provide a quick overview
over document's structure and allow easy navigation through the provided
hyperlinks.

2. Support for a Table-Of-Contents structure

From what I've seen in JFreeReport 0.9, implementing this feature using the
same approach as outlined in the CSS3-PagedMedia module, this should be easy
to implement (even in the old engine). The worst impact that will happen, is
that this feature may eat a lot of memory on large structures (but memory is
cheap and if no-one prints a Table-of-Contents, no memory is wasted on that
task anyway).
