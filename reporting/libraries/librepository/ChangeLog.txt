1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

1.1.6: (2010-04-27)
       * [BUG] PRD-2443: File Repository needs to accept zero-length files as
         valid, as the TempFileGenerator will use File#createTempFile(..)
         which creates a file to make sure it's name is and stays unique.

       * [BUG] PRD-2442: DefaultNameGenerator created names in a sequential order,
         which is incredible slow on large directories and also poses a security
         risk as names can be guessed easily.

1.1.2: (2009-09-25)
       * [BUG] Lookup of mime-types for a given file extensions failed due to an
         invalid configuration prefix.

       * Switched the configuration schema to use suffixes as key, as a mime-type
         can have multiple suffixes.

1.1.0: (2009-07-29)

       * Moved all code from org.jfree.repository to the new package space
         org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.repository

       * Added support for Mime-Email output.

       * [BUG] PRE-412: A off-by-one index error in DefaultNameGenerator produced
         invalid names.

       * The Mime-types that are recognized by the Mime-Registry can be configured
         via the global configuration now.

0.2.0: (30-May-2008)
       * Code-hardening: Explict checks for Null-Values added.
  
       * Switched from JCommon to LibBase. All version information is now contained in
         the manifest. The Project-Info implementation reads the version numbers from
         the Jar's Manifest or the compiler-output-directory.

       * Completed the ZIP repositories. The library now provides three flavors:
         - read-only streaming repository
         - write-only streaming repository
         - read-write memory-buffered repository

       * [BUG] Generating ZIP repositories was generally unstable. The repository did
         not write un-compressed entries as it required a precomputed CRC32 checksum.
         
0.1.6: (30-Nov-2007)
       * Updated the error messages for the file-repository.
         We now explicitly check whether the directories for
         the content-locations exist. If they do not exist,
         the implementation throws exceptions ..

0.1.5: (02-Nov-2007)
        * Upgraded to jcommon-1.0.12

0.1.4: (16-Oct-2007)
        * Automatic fixes as reported by IntelliJ-IDEA's inspections
    
        * Updated the copyright header on all java-files

0.1.3: (24-Sep-2007)
        * All releases are now built with JDK 1.4. However, we are still compatible
          with JDK 1.2.2 and all releases run and compile under that release.

0.1.2: (30-Jun-2007)
        * [BUG] The ZIP-Repository was not closed correctly, causing unreadable files.
    
        * The default-name-generator tries to extract a suitable default-suffix from
          the given default-filename.

0.1.1: (27-May-2007)
        * Added a mime-type mapping for CSS-files. Mime-Mapping should be configurable.
    
0.1.0: (03-Dec-2006)
        * Initial version.
